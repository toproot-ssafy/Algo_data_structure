## Tonic Notebooks

Any notebook in [Tonic](https://tonicdev.com) can also be a node module,
and can be required by any other notebook in Tonic like this:

    require("notebook")("tonic/package-server/1.0.0")

Here, `package-server` is the name of the notebook, and `1.0.0` is the
specific version we're requiring (using semver, of course).

Within Tonic this just works. Outside of Tonic, you can npm install this
package to make these requires work.

*Note*: this package currently makes blocking calls, so you probably don't
want to use it in performance sensitive places.
